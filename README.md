# How to build:
## Download and install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  Make sure to add the install directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
## Download a build of [ACC](https://github.com/ZDoom/acc/releases)
  Either put this in the main directory of the project, or point to the installation directory with `PATH`.
## Run `build.bat`
  If you plan on running the directory directly in GZDoom, use `compile_acs.bat` instead.


# Recommended tools for editing:
## [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  See [this thread](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=46674) for a custom user defined language to use with Notepad++.
