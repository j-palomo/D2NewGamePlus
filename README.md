# How to build:
## Download and install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  Make sure to add the install directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
## Download a build of [ACC](https://github.com/ZDoom/acc/releases)
  Either put this in the main directory of the project, or point to the installation directory with the `PATH` environment variable.
## Download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  See [this thread](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=46674) for a custom user defined language to use with Notepad++.
## Install NppExec for Notepad++
  This can be done by going to *'Plugins'*, then *'Plugins Admin'*. Select it from the list and click install.
## Setup your script
  Select *'Execute NppExec Script'* from the plugin menu. Use a change directory command to point it to the location of **npp_build** in the root directory of the project. For example:
  
    cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Doom\editing\NewGame+\
    npp_exec npp_build
